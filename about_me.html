   <h1 align ="center">About Me</h1>

<p align = "center"> I am currently a Senior at Gahr High that transferred from Bishop Montgomery.
I am the Quaterback for our football team and enjoy spending my time learning about code. I have about a year of experience in coding (swift 3.0 and C#),
but still want to further my knowledge in this subject. One day I plan on working for a big company whether it be working on a website or programming an
application.</p>
